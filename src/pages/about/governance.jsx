                    Board members are identified from within the field of academics, governance and other related fields to the programmes and 
                    work of the organisation. Recommendations are made by existing board members or other funders, collaborators, partners. All 
                    referrals are discussed within the Board and members are selected and appointed unanimously by the Board. The Board has a policy 
                    of rotation every two years, this is when new members are identified and inducted into the board. So far any renewal is based on 
                    the unanimous decision of the Board or on a case to case basis if required.
